<br>Achieving healthy lifestyles and promoting well-being for all people of all ages is the goal of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3. It covers objectives such as reducing maternal mortality, ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under five years of age, and achieving universal health coverage. SDG 10 strives to lessen inequality both inside and between nations. It includes targets such as ensuring equal opportunities and promoting the social, economic, and political inclusion of all. These two goals are closely related to improving access to healthcare for marginalized communities. Despite progress in recent years, many people worldwide still need access to essential health services. Marginalized communities, in particular, face significant barriers to accessing healthcare. These barriers include discrimination, poverty, lack of education, and geographic isolation.

According to Coombs, Campbell, and Caringi (2022), certain aspects of healthcare access are challenging to measure, specifically factors that affect the acceptability and appropriateness of healthcare services. These factors are associated with a patient's willingness to receive services and the need to ensure that the services align with the patient's specific healthcare requirements.These dimensions of access are particularly evident in rural healthcare systems, where additional structural barriers hinder the accessibility of healthcare. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the barriers to healthcare access in such settings.Improving access to healthcare for marginalized communities is essential for achieving SDG 3 and SDG 10. Ensuring everyone has access to quality healthcare can reduce health inequalities and promote well-being for all. It includes providing access to essential medicines and vaccines and ensuring that healthcare services are affordable and accessible.

However, there is still much work that needs to be done. Many marginalized communities continue to face significant barriers to accessing healthcare. Addressing these barriers will require concerted efforts from governments, healthcare providers, and civil society organizations. It may include implementing policies that promote equity in healthcare access, investing in healthcare infrastructure in underserved areas, and addressing social determinants of health.

The problem remains that marginalized communities will continue to suffer from preventable illnesses and poor health outcomes without proper access to healthcare. It affects the individuals in these communities and has broader social and economic impacts. By working towards achieving SDG 3 and SDG 10, we can improve access to healthcare for marginalized communities and promote health equity for all. By improving healthcare access for marginalized communities, it will not only contribute to the achievement of SDG 3 and SDG 10 but also fosters a more inclusive and equitable society, where every individual has the opportunity to lead a healthy and fulfilling life.

Marginalized communities often lack access to quality healthcare services, leading to poor health outcomes and reduced well-being. By tackling all main health issues, SDG 3 seeks to guarantee healthy lifestyles and promote well-being for all ages. With the understanding that inequality begins with birth inequity and can impede opportunities for people to realize their rights and potential, SDG 10 aspires to eradicate inequality within and between nations. In many countries, access to primary healthcare services, including essential medicines and vaccines, is a barrier to good health and well-being.

Access to quality healthcare is a fundamental human right, yet millions worldwide still lack access to essential healthcare services. This is particularly true for marginalized communities, including low-income populations, people living in rural areas, and ethnic minorities. These communities' lack of healthcare services often leads to higher rates of preventable diseases, poorer health outcomes, and shorter life expectancies. Furthermore, inequalities in healthcare access also exacerbate existing social and economic disparities, perpetuating a cycle of poverty and ill health.

The problem of healthcare inequality is further compounded by systemic issues such as racism, discrimination, and unequal distribution of healthcare resources. Marginalized communities are often underserved and overlooked by healthcare providers and policymakers, leading to a lack of appropriate and culturally sensitive healthcare services. In addition, marginalized communities are more likely to face barriers to healthcare access, such as lack of transportation, limited healthcare facilities, and language barriers. The COVID-19 pandemic has also exposed and exacerbated these existing healthcare inequalities, with marginalized communities bearing a disproportionate burden of the pandemic's impact.


Another critical problem is reducing inequities within and between nations, with income inequality and discrimination frequently sustaining social and economic differences. Addressing these complicated concerns necessitates a multifaceted strategy that includes improving healthcare infrastructure, promoting public health education, and advocating for equity and social justice legislation. Discrimination based on various factors can disadvantage individuals throughout their lives, perpetuating patterns of inequality from generation to generation. Early interventions and investing in all children, especially the poorest and most marginalized, are central to breaking intergenerational poverty and inequality.

<br>Improving access to healthcare is a key challenge facing many communities worldwide, particularly those marginalized or underserved. Marginalized communities often face barriers to accessing healthcare services, including financial, geographic, and cultural barriers, leading to poor health outcomes and persistent healthcare disparities. Managing these challenges requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach that addresses the root causes of healthcare inequality and promotes health equity for all. The proposed project, which aims to improve access to healthcare for marginalized communities, will benefit a wide range of people, including:
* <b>The Marginalized communities</b>. By improving access to healthcare services, marginalized communities can receive the care and support they need to achieve good health and well-being, which can improve their quality of life and promote social and economic mobility. Access to healthcare services can also reduce the burden of healthcare costs on low-income populations, which can positively impact their financial well-being.<br><br>
* <b>The Healthcare providers</b>. Healthcare providers, including doctors, nurses, and other healthcare professionals, will benefit from the project by having more opportunities to provide care to underserved communities, which can be professionally fulfilling and rewarding. In addition, by addressing healthcare inequalities, providers can help promote health equity and reduce disparities in health outcomes. This can contribute to better patient outcomes, which can be personally and professionally satisfying for providers.<br><br>
* <b>The Policymakers and government officials</b>. Policymakers and government officials will benefit from the project by better understanding the challenges marginalized communities face when accessing healthcare services. This can inform the development of more effective and equitable healthcare policies, which can also benefit the broader population. The project's findings can also be used to evaluate and refine existing policies, ensuring they meet underserved communities' needs.<br><br>
* <b>The Future researchers</b>. Future researchers can benefit from the project by gaining valuable insights into the most effective mechanisms and strategies to improve healthcare access and reduce healthcare inequalities. This can inform the development of future research projects and policy and programmatic interventions aimed at improving healthcare access and reducing healthcare disparities. The project can also contribute to the ongoing conversation around health equity and social justice, advancing the field and promoting positive change.<br>
