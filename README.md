## IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FOR MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES

Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being <br>
Sustainable Development Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities

### INTRODUCTION
Achieving healthy lifestyles and promoting well-being for all people at all ages is the goal of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3. This covers objectives such as reducing maternal mortality, ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, and achieving universal health coverage.  SDG 10 strives to lessen inequality both inside and between nations. This includes targets such as ensuring equal opportunities and promoting the social, economic, and political inclusion of all. These two goals are closely related when it comes to improving access to healthcare for marginalized communities. Despite progress in recent years, many people around the world still lack access to essential health services. Marginalized communities, in particular, face significant barriers to accessing healthcare. These barriers can include discrimination, poverty, lack of education, and geographic isolation.

Improving access to healthcare for marginalized communities is essential for achieving both SDG 3 and SDG 10. By ensuring that everyone has access to quality healthcare, we can reduce health inequalities and promote well-being for all. This includes providing access to essential medicines and vaccines, as well as ensuring that healthcare services are affordable and accessible.

However, there is still much work to be done. Many marginalized communities continue to face significant barriers to accessing healthcare. Addressing these barriers will require concerted efforts from governments, healthcare providers, and civil society organizations. This may include implementing policies that promote equity in healthcare access, investing in healthcare infrastructure in underserved areas, and addressing social determinants of health.

The problem remains that without proper access to healthcare, marginalized communities will continue to suffer from preventable illnesses and poor health outcomes. This not only affects the individuals in these communities but also has broader social and economic impacts. By working towards achieving SDG 3 and SDG 10, we can improve access to healthcare for marginalized communities and promote health equity for all.
