## IMPROVING ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FOR MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES

Sustainable Development Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being <br>
Sustainable Development Goal 10: Reduced Inequalities

### INTRODUCTION
Achieving healthy lifestyles and promoting well-being for all people of all ages is the goal of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 3. It covers objectives such as reducing maternal mortality, ending preventable deaths of newborns and children under five years of age, and achieving universal health coverage. SDG 10 strives to lessen inequality both inside and between nations. It includes targets such as ensuring equal opportunities and promoting the social, economic, and political inclusion of all. These two goals are closely related to improving access to healthcare for marginalized communities. Despite progress in recent years, many people worldwide still need access to essential health services. Marginalized communities, in particular, face significant barriers to accessing healthcare. These barriers include discrimination, poverty, lack of education, and geographic isolation.

Improving access to healthcare for marginalized communities is essential for achieving SDG 3 and SDG 10. Ensuring everyone has access to quality healthcare can reduce health inequalities and promote well-being for all. It includes providing access to essential medicines and vaccines and ensuring that healthcare services are affordable and accessible.

However, there is still much work that needs to be done. Many marginalized communities continue to face significant barriers to accessing healthcare. Addressing these barriers will require concerted efforts from governments, healthcare providers, and civil society organizations. It may include implementing policies that promote equity in healthcare access, investing in healthcare infrastructure in underserved areas, and addressing social determinants of health.

The problem remains that marginalized communities will continue to suffer from preventable illnesses and poor health outcomes without proper access to healthcare. It affects the individuals in these communities and has broader social and economic impacts. By working towards achieving SDG 3 and SDG 10, we can improve access to healthcare for marginalized communities and promote health equity for all.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
Marginalized communities often lack access to quality healthcare services, leading to poor health outcomes and reduced well-being. By tackling all main health issues, SDG 3 seeks to guarantee healthy lifestyles and promote well-being for all ages. With the understanding that inequality begins with birth inequity and can impede opportunities for people to realize their rights and potential, SDG 10 aspires to eradicate inequality within and between nations. In many countries, access to primary healthcare services, including essential medicines and vaccines, is a barrier to good health and well-being. It is especially troublesome in low-income communities, where disparities in access to healthcare and education can lead to a continuous cycle of poverty and illness.

Furthermore, the prevalence of non-communicable illnesses such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease is increasing, with lifestyle factors and environmental pollutants playing a role. Another critical problem is reducing inequities within and between nations, with income inequality and discrimination frequently sustaining social and economic differences. Addressing these complicated concerns necessitates a multifaceted strategy that includes improving healthcare infrastructure, promoting public health education, and advocatingÂ for equity and social justice legislation. Discrimination based on various factors can disadvantage individuals throughout their lives, perpetuating patterns of inequality from generation to generation. Early interventions and investing in all children, especially the poorest and most marginalized, are central to breaking intergenerational poverty and inequality.
